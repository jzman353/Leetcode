"""
Given a blacklist B containing unique integers from [0, N), write a function to return a uniform random integer from [0, N) which is NOT in B.

Optimize it such that it minimizes the call to systemâ€™s Math.random().

Note:

    1 <= N <= 1000000000
    0 <= B.length < min(100000, N)
    [0, N) does NOT include N. See interval notation.

Example 1:

Input:
["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
[[1,[]],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,0,0,0]

Example 2:

Input:
["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
[[2,[]],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,1,1,1]

Example 3:

Input:
["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
[[3,[1]],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,0,0,2]

Example 4:

Input:
["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
[[4,[2]],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,1,3,1]

Explanation of Input Syntax:

The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. Solution's constructor has two arguments, N and the blacklist B. pick has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.

#The issue with this code is that it has to repeatedly guess until it doesn't hit a blacklisted item
#To make the code more efficient, we need to create a list of whitelisted intervals
#To do this, sort the blacklist and make a list that finds all the spaces in blacklist
#Then, randomly choose a whitelisted range (it should be weighted by the number of numbers in the interval)
#Then, randomly choose a number within that whitelisted range

This is the first time I am getting a 100% time performance on LC so it may be a bit of luck.

Generally, there are 3 things to consider: size of the population to pick up from (N), size of the blacklist (B) and the number of queries (which is unknown). By testing the first version of my solution I got TLE and this is when I realised that the number of queries can be really large (I saw a test case with 20K queries).

If there are a lot of queries it makes sense to do as much pre-processing as possible. So after getting the TLE with 20K queries I went for a white list approach. Which got me another TLE of a case with a large N and small B.

So I went for a balance between the black and white list: if B is greater than N // 3 than it makes sense to do a white list.

This is, essentially, a bit of LC hacking (the solution was informed by the 2 TLEs) so take it for what it is.

Complexity for the preprocessing is N + B for the white list approach and just B for the black list one.

class Solution:

    def __init__(self, N: int, blacklist: List[int]):
        self.b, self.ra, self.l = frozenset(blacklist), range(N), len(blacklist) > N // 3
        if self.l: self.ra = [x for x in self.ra if x not in self.b] #white list
        self.r = random.choices(self.ra, k = 1000)

    def pick(self) -> int:
        while True:
            if not self.r: self.r = random.choices(self.ra, k = 1000)
            c = self.r.pop()
            if self.l: return c
            elif c not in self.b: return c  #white list
