Sorting a list and returning the indexes of the sorted values is often useful
sorted_A = sorted(range(len(A)), key=lambda k: A[k])
Array > Medium Width Ramp

collections.Counter is useful for counting occurrences in lists
itertools product is useful when you need permutations with repetition allowed
Morse Code>Cisco_Morse_Code_Challenge
import collections
    cnt = collections.Counter()
    for word in morse_words:
        cnt[word] += 1
    print(cnt.most_common(10))
permutations_list = [p for p in itertools.product(x, repeat=13)]
