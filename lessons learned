heapq is a min heap setup built in to python
heapq.heapify(heap) will turn a list (heap) into a heap item
https://docs.python.org/2/library/heapq.html

collections is a more complex list of datatypes available in python
https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html
deque is perfect for popping items from both directions (stack and/or queue)
counter is useful for building hash tables to count items. You can use the most_common function

hash() will return a unique hash number for any item. You can use this to find anagrams by summing the hash of letters and comparing them. abc == cab
hash('a')+hash('b')+hash('c') == hash('c')+hash('a')+hash('b')

#uses heapq, which is a min heap setup
#uses negative freq because it wants the highest frequency to be the first 
#available in the queue but then uses negative again to make it a 
#positive number again
