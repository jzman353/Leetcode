heapq is a min heap setup built in to python
heapq.heapify(heap) will turn a list (heap) into a heap item
https://docs.python.org/2/library/heapq.html

collections is a more complex list of datatypes available in python
https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html
deque is perfect for popping items from both directions (stack and/or queue)
counter is useful for building hash tables to count items. You can use the most_common function

hash() will return a unique hash number for any item. You can use this to find anagrams by summing the hash of letters and comparing them. abc == cab
hash('a')+hash('b')+hash('c') == hash('c')+hash('a')+hash('b')

#uses heapq, which is a min heap setup
#uses negative freq because it wants the highest frequency to be the first 
#available in the queue but then uses negative again to make it a 
#positive number again

Sorting a list and returning the indexes of the sorted values is often useful
sorted_A = sorted(range(len(A)), key=lambda k: A[k])
Array > Medium Width Ramp
Sorting a list of lists by one of the indexes:
l.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])

collections.Counter is useful for counting occurrences in lists
itertools product is useful when you need permutations with repetition allowed

        cnt[word] += 1

Initializing a two dimensional list:
x = [[foo for i in range(10)] for j in range(10)]

remove multiple items from a list in one line:

find out if the sum of three dice rolls is prime:

    event can be either a set of outcomes, or a predicate (true for outcomes in the event)."""

combining a list of numbers to a string:
ans = ''.join(map(str, LIST))

l1 = [1,"hi",None]
#creating a shallow copy of a list
l2 = l1 #This changes the memory location of l2
#creating a deep copy of a list

zip two lists into one:
ans = []
for j, k in zip(list1, list2):
    ans.append(j)
    ans.append(k)

find all indexes of a char in a string:

get kth column of a matrix:

finding columns of a list of lists:
return sum([list(col) != sorted(col) for col in zip(*A)])
The * indicates that A is an iterable

#Unzips the list and compares each letter to all other letters in all other words until one doesn't match and then breaks
#group will look like ['f','f','f'] for the first example
